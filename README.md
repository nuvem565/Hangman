Generaly speaking, I program from the beginning of my college studies, through some engineering applications (unfortunatelly, not commercial ones) up to my engineering, bachelor thesis written in F#. For me, it's of course mostly proffessional matter, but very important. I programmed many things but it was mainly amateur work and I lack of good, reliable, proffessional experience. In my opinion, after implementing amateur interpreter doing my thesis project, I need to do fully commercial project that test my persistence. Programming is hard, but doing this fills me with satisfaction after all. I have started internship in industrial automation and it was so far so good, but it tends to be a work with night shifts or business trips. Eventually, these two proffessions aren't too far off and more and more information technologies gets into the industrial applications.
